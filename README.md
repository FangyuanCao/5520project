# Commit strategy and Branch handlement
### Branching
The main branch is the only one we commit to with valid changes. We previously create two branches mainly for local test and experiment. These two additional branches were used to learn the process with Github, however, we decide to mainly focus on main branch as rest for rest of the development process

### Commit strategy
We started developping the project in late September
The main strategy we used is the incremental and agile development that implement and integrate components with different iterations.
